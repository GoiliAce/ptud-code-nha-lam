# One Man Army: A Todo List and CV List Project
Welcome to my humble repository, where I showcase my skills in application development by building a todo list and CV list application.

## My Story
Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, a lone developer decided to embark on a journey to learn the art of app development. Armed with only his wits and determination, he stumbled upon two powerful tools - a todo list and a CV list - that would help him organize his tasks and showcase his skills to the world.

## My Mission
My mission is simple - to share my journey with the world, and inspire others to take up the mantle of application development. In my repository, you will find two branches - a todo list branch, and a CV list branch - each representing a crucial aspect of my journey.

In the todo list branch, I showcase my mastery of Django, as I build a powerful and intuitive todo list application. From creating models and views, to implementing CRUD operations and authentication, I leave no stone unturned in my quest for perfection.

In the CV list branch, I showcase my creativity and flair, as I design a stunning and professional CV using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. From selecting the perfect font, to crafting the perfect layout, I show you how to create a CV that truly stands out from the crowd.

## My Future
My journey is far from over, and I have many more challenges to overcome. But with my trusty todo and CV lists by my side, I am confident that I can conquer any obstacle that comes my way. Join me on my journey, and let me show you the magic of application development.

## Getting Started
To get started with my project, simply clone my repository and switch to the todo list branch:
``` python
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/GoiliAce/ptud-exercises.git
cd ptud-exercises
git checkout tuan_3(django)
```
From there, follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up and run the todo list application.

## Credits
This project was created by a lone developer who is committed to pushing the boundaries of application development. Special thanks to the online resources and tutorials that have guided me on my journey and inspired me to be the best that I can be.
