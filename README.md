# A Tale of Two Lists
Welcome to our humble abode, where we juggle two lists - a todo list and a CV list - in our quest to conquer the world of application development.

## Our Story
Once upon a time, in a land far far away, a group of aspiring developers decided to embark on a journey to learn the art of app development. As they stumbled and fumbled through the treacherous terrain of code, they stumbled upon two powerful tools - a todo list and a CV list. With these lists by their side, they were able to organize their tasks, track their progress, and showcase their skills to the world.

## Our Mission
Our mission is simple - to share our journey with the world, and inspire others to take up the mantle of application development. In our repository, you will find two branches - a todo list branch, and a CV list branch - each representing a crucial aspect of our journey.

In the todo list branch, we showcase our mastery of Django, as we build a powerful and intuitive todo list application. From creating models and views, to implementing CRUD operations and authentication, we leave no stone unturned in our quest for perfection.

In the CV list branch, we showcase our creativity and flair, as we design a stunning and professional CV using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. From selecting the perfect font, to crafting the perfect layout, we show you how to create a CV that truly stands out from the crowd.

## Our Future
Our journey is far from over, and we have many more challenges to overcome. But with our trusty todo and CV lists by our side, we are confident that we can conquer any obstacle that comes our way. Join us on our journey, and let us show you the magic of application development.

## Getting Started
To get started with our project, simply clone our repository and switch to the todo list branch:

``` python
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/GoiliAce/ptud-exercises.git
cd ptud-exercises
git checkout tuan_3(django)
```
From there, follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up and run the todo list application.

## Credits
This project was created by a group of talented and ambitious developers, who are committed to pushing the boundaries of application development. Special thanks to our mentors and teachers, who have guided us on our journey and inspired us to be the best that we can be.
